        Whats In My Image V2.7.1
      </title>

            <p>
V2.7.1 Now has a Show Visible Objects Only button.  Use the wrench icon to adjust the threshold of the visibility.  Defualt is 1 sigma above the median.  A lot of times when you query there are a lot of objects that are just too dim in your image.  This will look at that location and compare it to the images median.  If it is above a certain threshold it will keep the object, otherwise it is too dim and removes it.  Now your collage and annotated image will only have what you can actually see in your image!

Thank you to my contributor Gedas W8BYA EN70JT for the encouragement to implement this!
