V2 bring an option to freehand draw your blemish removal area.  Ctrl+click and drag to define a line to remove satellite trails.  Alt+click on a satellite trail to auto find the trail, this is still in the experimental phase!  Undo now restores the previously drawn areas to make tweaking your feathering or opacity much faster.  Undo also now correctly works with AutoSTF functionality.
